# Applying ML to real-world use cases
#### This repository is a collection of solution approaches and source codes of my solutions to - (a) projects to solve real-life problems and (2) online challenges and hackathons by Kaggle, Analytics Vidhya, Machine Hack etc.

## Index:
* [Intel-Scene-Classification-Challenge](AV-Intel-Scene-Classification-Challenge) (hosted by Analytics Vidhya)<br>
From a set of images of outdoor scenes, identify and classify the type of scene - mountains, glaciers, streets, buildings, forests etc.

* [Kaggle-Aerial-Cactus-Identification](Kaggle-Aerial-Cactus-Identification) (hosted by Kaggle)<br>
In this competition, you are tasked with creation of an algorithm that can identify a specific type of cactus in aerial imagery.

* [Doctor-Fee-Prediction](MH-Doctor-Fee-Prediction) (hosted by Machine Hack)<br>
Based on multiple attributes, build a model to predict doctor’s consulting fee.
